## Deep Learning with Noisy Labels for Spatio-Temporal Drought Detection

# Abstract
Droughts pose significant challenges for accurate detection due to their complex spatio-temporal characteristics. Data-driven machine learning models have shown promise in detecting extreme events when enough well-annotated data is available. However, droughts do not have a unique and precise definition, which leads to noise in human-annotated events and presents an imperfect learning scenario for deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel 3D convolutional neural network designed to address the complex task of drought detection, considering noisy and inaccurate labels. Motivated by the shortcomings of traditional drought indices, we leverage supervised learning with labeled events from multiple sources, capturing the shared conceptual space among diverse definitions of drought. Our model outperforms existing indices when detecting events in Europe between 2003 and 2015, offering a more adaptive and reliable solution. Additionally, we employ several strategies to further mitigate the negative effect of noisy labels during training, including a proposed label correction method that relies on model predictions, enhancing the robustness and performance of the detection model. Both the proposed model and the methodology for robust learning aim to advance the field of drought detection, providing a comprehensive solution to label noise and conceptual variability.
